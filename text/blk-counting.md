% Counting

## Repetition with replacement

Counting things in a macro is a surprisingly tricky task.  The simplest way is to use replacement with a repetition match.

```rust
macro_rules! replace_expr {
    ($_t:tt $sub:expr) => {$sub};
}

macro_rules! count_tts {
    ($($tts:tt)*) => {0usize $(+ replace_expr!($tts 1usize))*};
}
# 
# fn main() {
#     assert_eq!(count_tts!(0 1 2), 3);
# }
```

This is a fine approach for smallish numbers, but will likely *crash the compiler* with inputs of around 500 or so tokens.  Consider that the output will look something like this:

```ignore
0usize + 1usize + /* ~500 `+ 1usize`s */ + 1usize
```

The compiler must parse this into an AST, which will produce what is effectively a perfectly unbalanced binary tree 500+ levels deep.

## Recursion

An older approach is to use recursion.

```rust
macro_rules! count_tts {
    () => {0usize};
    ($_head:tt $($tail:tt)*) => {1usize + count_tts!($($tail)*)};
}
# 
# fn main() {
#     assert_eq!(count_tts!(0 1 2), 3);
# }
```

> **Note**: As of `rustc` 1.2, the compiler has *grevious* performance problems when large numbers of integer literals of unknown type must undergo inference.  We are using explicitly `usize`-typed literals here to avoid that.
>
> If this is not suitable (such as when the type must be substitutable), you can help matters by using `as` (*e.g.* `0 as $ty`, `1 as $ty`, *etc.*).

This *works*, but will trivially exceed the recursion limit.  Unlike the repetition approach, you can extend the input size by matching multiple tokens at once.

```rust
macro_rules! count_tts {
    ($_a:tt $_b:tt $_c:tt $_d:tt $_e:tt
     $_f:tt $_g:tt $_h:tt $_i:tt $_j:tt
     $_k:tt $_l:tt $_m:tt $_n:tt $_o:tt
     $_p:tt $_q:tt $_r:tt $_s:tt $_t:tt
     $($tail:tt)*)
        => {20usize + count_tts!($($tail)*)};
    ($_a:tt $_b:tt $_c:tt $_d:tt $_e:tt
     $_f:tt $_g:tt $_h:tt $_i:tt $_j:tt
     $($tail:tt)*)
        => {10usize + count_tts!($($tail)*)};
    ($_a:tt $_b:tt $_c:tt $_d:tt $_e:tt
     $($tail:tt)*)
        => {5usize + count_tts!($($tail)*)};
    ($_a:tt
     $($tail:tt)*)
        => {1usize + count_tts!($($tail)*)};
    () => {0usize};
}

fn main() {
    assert_eq!(700, count_tts!(
        ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,,
        ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,,
        
        ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,,
        ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,,
        
        ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,,
        ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,,
        
        ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,,
        ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,,
        
        ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,,
        ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,,
        
        // Repetition breaks somewhere after this
        ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,,
        ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,,

        ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,,
        ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,,,,
    ));
}
```

This particular formulation will work up to ~1,200 tokens.

## Slice length

A third approach is to help the compiler construct a shallow AST that won't lead to a stack overflow.  This can be done by constructing an array literal and calling the `len` method.

```rust
macro_rules! replace_expr {
    ($_t:tt $sub:expr) => {$sub};
}

macro_rules! count_tts {
    ($($tts:tt)*) => {<[()]>::len(&[$(replace_expr!($tts ())),*])};
}
# 
# fn main() {
#     assert_eq!(count_tts!(0 1 2), 3);
# }
```

This has been tested to work up to 10,000 tokens, and can probably go much higher.  The *downside* is that as of Rust 1.2, this *cannot* be used to produce a constant expression.  Although the result can be optimised to a simple constant (in debug builds it compiles down to a load from memory), it still cannot be used in constant positions (such as the value of `const`s, or a fixed array's size).

However, if a non-constant count is acceptable, this is very much the preferred method.

## Enum counting

This approach can be used where you need to count a set of mutually distinct identifiers.  Additionally, the result of this approach is usable as a constant.

```rust
macro_rules! count_idents {
    ($($idents:ident),* $(,)*) => {
        {
            #[allow(dead_code, non_camel_case_types)]
            enum Idents { $($idents,)* __CountIdentsLast }
            const COUNT: u32 = Idents::__CountIdentsLast as u32;
            COUNT
        }
    };
}
# 
# fn main() {
#     const COUNT: u32 = count_idents!(A, B, C);
#     assert_eq!(COUNT, 3);
# }
```

This method does have two drawbacks.  First, as implied above, it can *only* count valid identifiers (which are also not keywords), and it does not allow those identifiers to repeat.

Secondly, this approach is *not* hygienic, meaning that if whatever identifier you use in place of `__CountIdentsLast` is provided as input, the macro will fail due to the duplicate variants in the `enum`.

## Logarithmic counting

This approach is similar to Recursion, with the difference that every (one or two) recursive calls, the number of tokens to count is *divided by two*, instead of being reduced by one. Therefore, the recursion depth is the binary logarithm of the number of tokens to count and the expanded tree is likewise very small.

```rust
macro_rules! count_tts {
    ()        => {0usize};
    ($one:tt) => {1usize};
    ($($pairs:tt $_p:tt)*) => {
        count_tts!($($pairs)*) << 1usize
    };
    ($odd:tt $($rest:tt)*) => {
        count_tts!($($rest)*) | 1usize
    };
}
```

Here is the expansion for 51 tokens:

```rust
count_tts!(---------------------------------------------------)
count_tts!(--------------------------------------------------) | 1
count_tts!(-------------------------)     << 1 | 1
count_tts!(------------------------)  | 1 << 1 | 1
count_tts!(------------)         << 1 | 1 << 1 | 1
count_tts!(------)          << 1 << 1 | 1 << 1 | 1
count_tts!(---)        << 1 << 1 << 1 | 1 << 1 | 1
count_tts!(--)     | 1 << 1 << 1 << 1 | 1 << 1 | 1
count_tts!(-) << 1 | 1 << 1 << 1 << 1 | 1 << 1 | 1
            1 << 1 | 1 << 1 << 1 << 1 | 1 << 1 | 1
```

With this approach, the default recursion limit (64) is enough to count up to 2^64 tokens, which is more data than hard drives will be able to hold for the foreseeable future. It is quite fast (twice as fast as the Slice Length, for example, with an input of 100,000 tokens) and it produces a constant expression.
