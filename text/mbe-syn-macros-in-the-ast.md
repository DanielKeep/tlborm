% Macros in the AST

As previously mentioned, macro processing in Rust happens *after* the construction of the AST.  As such, the syntax used to invoke a macro *must* be a proper part of the language's syntax.  In fact, there are several "syntax extension" forms which are part of Rust's syntax.  Specifically, the following forms (by way of examples):

* `# [ $arg ]`; *e.g.* `#[derive(Clone)]`, `#[no_mangle]`, …
* `# ! [ $arg ]`; *e.g.* `#![allow(dead_code)]`, `#![crate_name="blang"]`, …
* `$name ! $arg`; *e.g.* `println!("Hi!")`, `concat!("a", "b")`, …
* `$name ! $arg0 $arg1`; *e.g.* `macro_rules! dummy { () => {}; }`.

The first two are "attributes", and are shared between both language-specific constructs (such as `#[repr(C)]` which is used to request a C-compatible ABI for user-defined types) and syntax extensions (such as `#[derive(Clone)]`).  There is currently no way to define a macro that uses these forms.

The third is the one of interest to us: it is the form available for use with macros.  Note that this form is not *limited* to macros: it is a generic syntax extension form.  For example, whilst `format!` is a macro, `format_args!` (which is used to *implement* `format!`) is *not*.

The fourth is essentially a variation which is *not* available to macros.  In fact, the only case where this form is used *at all* is with `macro_rules!` which, again we will come back to.

Disregarding all but the third form (`$name ! $arg`), the question becomes: how does the Rust parser know what `$arg` looks like for every possible syntax extension?  The answer is that it doesn't *have to*.  Instead, the argument of a syntax extension invocation is a *single* token tree.  More specifically, it is a single, *non-leaf* token tree; `(...)`, `[...]`, or `{...}`.  With that knowledge, it should become apparent how the parser can understand all of the following invocation forms:

```ignore
bitflags! {
    flags Color: u8 {
        const RED    = 0b0001,
        const GREEN  = 0b0010,
        const BLUE   = 0b0100,
        const BRIGHT = 0b1000,
    }
}

lazy_static! {
    static ref FIB_100: u32 = {
        fn fib(a: u32) -> u32 {
            match a {
                0 => 0,
                1 => 1,
                a => fib(a-1) + fib(a-2)
            }
        }

        fib(100)
    };
}

fn main() {
    let colors = vec![RED, GREEN, BLUE];
    println!("Hello, World!");
}
```

Although the above invocations may *look* like they contain various kinds of Rust code, the parser simply sees a collection of meaningless token trees.  To make this clearer, we can replace all these syntactic "black boxes" with ⬚, leaving us with:

```text
bitflags! ⬚

lazy_static! ⬚

fn main() {
    let colors = vec! ⬚;
    println! ⬚;
}
```

Just to reiterate: the parser does not assume *anything* about ⬚; it remembers the tokens it contains, but doesn't try to *understand* them.

The important takeaways are:

* There are multiple kinds of syntax extension in Rust.  We will *only* be talking about macros defined by the `macro_rules!` construct.
* Just because you see something of the form `$name! $arg`, doesn't mean it's actually a macro; it might be another kind of syntax extension.
* The input to every macro is a single non-leaf token tree.
* Macros (really, syntax extensions in general) are parsed as *part* of the abstract syntax tree.

> **Aside**: due to the first point, some of what will be said below (including the next paragraph) will apply to syntax extensions *in general*.[^writer-is-lazy]

[^writer-is-lazy]: This is rather convenient as "macro" is much quicker and easier to type than "syntax extension".

The last point is the most important, as it has *significant* implications.  Because macros are parsed into the AST, they can **only** appear in positions where they are explicitly supported.  Specifically macros can appear in place of the following:

* Patterns
* Statements
* Expressions
* Items
* `impl` Items

Some things *not* on this list:

* Identifiers
* Match arms
* Struct fields
* Types[^type-macros]

[^type-macros]: Type macros are available in unstable Rust with `#![feature(type_macros)]`; see [Issue #27336](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27245).

There is absolutely, definitely *no way* to use macros in any position *not* on the first list.
