# The Little Book of Rust Macros

**Note**: this is *very much* a work in progress.

This book is an attempt to distil the Rust community's collective knowledge of Rust macros.  As such, both additions (in the form of pull requests) and requests (in the form of issues) are welcome.

If you wish to contribute, see [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/DanielKeep/tlborm/).

## Wanted

* A nicer CSS theme.
* Parsing/expansion techniques and patterns.
* Useful building blocks.
* Porting "A Practical Intro to Macros in Rust 1.0" to the book (with appropriate updates for the likely future-proofing changes).

## Being worked on

* The MBE chapter.
